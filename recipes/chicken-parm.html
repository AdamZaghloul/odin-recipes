    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 boneless skinless chicken breasts about 5oz each</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>⅔ cup Panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>⅔ cup seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        <li>⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt divided</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper divided</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons olive oil or as needed</li>
        <li>24 ounces marinara sauce homemade or jarred</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh basil for garnish</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F.</li>
        <li>Place the flour in a shallow bowl or dish. Place the eggs in a second shallow dish and beat with a fork.</li>
        <li>In a third shallow dish, combine Panko breadcrumbs, seasoned breadcrumbs, grated Parmesan cheese, 2 tablespoons chopped parsley, ½ teaspoon salt, and ¼ teaspoon pepper.</li>
        <li>Using the flat side of a meat mallet, pound the chicken breasts to ½-inch thickness. After pounding, if they're very large, you can cut them in half. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels and season with ½ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon black pepper.</li>
        <li>Dip both sides of the chicken into the flour and shake to remove any excess. Dip chicken in beaten eggs, then into the breadcrumb mixture and gently press to adhere. </li>
        <li>Preheat the oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Brown the chicken for about 2 minutes per side or until golden, it does not need to cook through.</li>
        <li>In the bottom of a 9×13 baking dish, add 1 ½ cups of marinara sauce. Add the browned chicken. Top each piece of chicken with 2 tablespoons of marinara sauce in the center. Top with mozzarella and shredded parmesan.</li>
        <li>Bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden and bubbly and the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165°F with an instant-read thermometer.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with fresh basil and parsley and serve over pasta.</li>
    </ol>
